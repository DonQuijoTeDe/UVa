# UVa
I have done some UVa online problems to improve
my codeing technique and to pratice some useful
algorithms and data structures

## Reference
For some problems that really too hard to me, I
have looked for some solutions that **the other
authors** have already done on it and modifies it
do be my own knowledges :)
